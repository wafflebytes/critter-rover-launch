    question: "How do I book a pet sitter or dog walker?",
    answer: "It's simple! Enter your location, browse profiles of available caregivers, check their reviews and availability. Once you find the right match, select your dates and times, add any special instructions for your pet, and complete the booking with our secure payment system."
  },
  {
    question: "How are pet sitters verified?",
    answer: "All Critter caregivers go through our comprehensive verification process including ID verification, background checks, and interviews. We continuously monitor reviews to ensure high-quality service. Your pet's safety is our priority."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need to cancel a booking?",
    answer: "You can easily cancel through your account dashboard. If you cancel 48+ hours in advance, you'll receive a full refund. Cancellations within 48 hours may be subject to a partial fee to compensate sitters who've reserved that time for you."
  },
  {
    question: "Is there insurance coverage for my pet?",

  },
  {
    question: "How do reward points work?",

  },
  {
    question: "Can I meet the sitter before booking?",
    answer: "Absolutely! We encourage a complimentary meet-and-greet before your first booking with a new sitter. This helps ensure both you and your pet are comfortable with the caregiver before the actual service."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I become a pet sitter on Critter?",
    answer: "To join as a caregiver, click on the 'Apply Now' button and complete your profile detailing your experience and services offered. You'll need to pass our verification process, which includes ID verification and a background check. Once approved, you can start accepting bookings!"
  },
  {
    question: "How do I set my rates as a caregiver?",
    answer: "You can set your own rates based on your experience, services, and local market. We provide suggested rate ranges based on your location and service type to help you price competitively."
